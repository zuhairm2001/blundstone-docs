# Blundstone Inventory Reporting Handover

## Executive Summary

This handover document provides a comprehensive overview of the inventory reporting modernization project for Blundstone. The project was initiated following Microsoft's activation of a new warehouse-specific inventory feature, which required careful validation to ensure no disruption to existing reporting operations.

## Phase 1: Impact Analysis & Validation âœ… COMPLETE

### Objective
Verify that the new Microsoft feature would not negatively impact Blundstone's current reporting operations.

### Report of Findings

**Investigation Scope:**
- Schema comparison analysis on `ax7.inventtrans` table
- New table creation verification
- Stored procedure impact assessment

**Key Findings:**

**Schema Analysis**
- `ax7.inventtrans` table: No schema changes detected after feature activation
- No new tables were created after feature activation

**Stored Procedures Assessment**

Six stored procedures were identified for potential compatibility concerns:
- SL_EAInventoryJournalTrans
- SL_EASales
- SL_EASalesOrders
- SL_EAWHSContainer
- SL_EAWHSShipment
- SL_EAWHSWorks

**Result:** All procedures reviewed show no direct references to the `inventtrans` table, indicating minimal impact on existing reporting infrastructure.

**Important Considerations:**
- Microsoft's feature validator catches most potential errors except for read-only dependencies (primary focus of this investigation)
- No automatic backfill occurs to new tables
- Historical data remains in legacy `inventtrans` table

---

## Phase 2: New Fact Table Design & Implementation âœ… COMPLETE

### FactStockLevel Table

A new fact table was created to leverage warehouse-specific transactions from the new Microsoft feature.

**Purpose:** Provides detailed transaction-level stock movement data focused on warehouse operations

**Table Schema:** Located at `queries/CREATE_FactStockLevel_Table.sql`

**Key Dimensions:**
- Company Key, Product Key, Warehouse Key
- Product Inventory Key, Inventory Dimension Key

**Key Measures:**
- Physical Stock Quantity
- Available Stock Quantity
- Reserved Stock Quantity
- Ordered Stock Quantity
- On Order Stock Quantity

**Transaction Attributes:**
- Transaction Type, Transaction Status, Movement Type
- Inventory Date, Status Date
- Transaction Date

**Performance Optimization:**
- Primary key on `Stock Level Key`
- Unique non-clustered index on `Record Id` (for MERGE operations)
- Composite index on dimension keys with included measures
- Index on transaction date for time-based queries
- Separate indexes for product and warehouse level reporting
- Estimated data volume: Warehouse-specific transactions

---

## Phase 3: Summary Table Design âœ… COMPLETE (Not Yet Implemented)

### FactInventoryMovementSummary Table

A monthly aggregated summary table designed for efficient reporting and analytics.

**Purpose:** Provides consolidated monthly stock level snapshots across all warehouses

**Table Schema:** Located at `queries/CREATE_StockLevelSummary_Table.sql`

**Grain:** One row per product per warehouse per month

**Time Dimensions:**
- Year, Month
- Period Start Date, Period End Date
- Date Key (links to DimDate for last day of month)

**Beginning of Month (BOM) Measures:**
- BOM Physical Stock Quantity
- BOM Available Stock Quantity
- BOM Reserved Stock Quantity
- BOM On Order Stock Quantity

**End of Month (EOM) Measures:**
- EOM Physical Stock Quantity
- EOM Available Stock Quantity
- EOM Reserved Stock Quantity
- EOM On Order Stock Quantity

**Monthly Movement Calculations:**
- Total Inbound Quantity (receipts)
- Total Outbound Quantity (issues)
- Net Movement Quantity (Inbound - Outbound)
- Quantity Change (EOM - BOM)
- Inbound/Outbound Transaction Counts

**Stock Health Indicators:**
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)
- Stock Turnover Ratio
- Stockout Days
- Average Physical/Available Stock Quantities

**Performance Profile:**
- Estimated: ~50K rows/month across all warehouses/locations
- Estimated annual growth: ~2GB/year
- Clustered on Summary Key

## Outstanding Tasks & Handover To Dennis


**Archive Strategy Implementation**

## Key Technical Notes

### Data Integration Points

- **Legacy System:** `ax7.inventtrans` table (read-only for historical reference)
- **New Feature Source:** Warehouse-specific transaction tables (Microsoft feature)
- **Target Tables:** FactStockLevel (detail) + FactInventoryMovementSummary (summary)

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Non-Financial Focus:** All measures are quantity-based; no cost/financial data
2. **Warehouse Priority:** Designed specifically for warehouse operations
3. **Historical Preservation:** Legacy data remains intact for audit trails
4. **Performance Optimized:** Separate detail and summary tables for query efficiency
5. **Dimension Model:** Follows standard data warehouse dimension design patterns

### Critical Dependencies

- Dimension tables (DimCompany, DimProduct, DimWarehouse, DimInventoryDimension, DimDate)
- ETL_User and Report_User database roles (permissions granted in scripts)
- Regular ETL schedule for data freshness

## Handover Sign-Off

**Project Phase:** Complete (Tables designed and FactStockLevel implemented)

**To Be Completed By:** Dennis (PPN environment deployment & ongoing ETL)
